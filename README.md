# XHordes
## A modded version of the Hordes.io client to provide helpful features

### Installation

## NOTE: XHORDES AND FIREFOX DO NOT PLAY WELL TOGETHER. IT IS HIGHLY RECCOMENDED THAT YOU USING GOOGLE CHROME INSTEAD.
Installation is incredibly simple.

Depending on your browser (Chrome or Firefox) you'll need to install Tampermonkey for either [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), depending on your browser.

Go ahead and click [here](https://github.com/LegusX/xhordes/raw/master/XHordes.user.js) to install XHordes. Your userscript manager should then prompt you about installing XHordes. If you accept it, the userscript manager should install XHordes.
And you're done! You can now go to Hordes and check it out!

### Disabling XHordes
Should for whatever reason you want to temporarily disable XHordes, all you have to do is click on the Tampermonkey icon while on Hordes.io, then click on the little slider to set it to "off"
After that, you can just reload the page to have Hordes X-free!

### Re-enabling XHordes
If you want to renable XHordes after previously disabling it, head to the Hordes website and just click on the Tampermonkey icon once more and click the slider again, so that it reads "on"
Just reload the page and you'll be able to use XHordes once more!
